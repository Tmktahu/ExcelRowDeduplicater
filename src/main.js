// this is the main.js file
//testing git

// we are using https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs

// ask the user for a target file
// read the file, get the headers
// list the columns they can choose from
// itterate through all things using the column cell CONTENT as a key to deduplicate things
// splice records together so we don't override data as we go
// ask them where they want to save the new file (before or after??)
// write the deduplicated file.
